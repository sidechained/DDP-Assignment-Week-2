# Developing Data Products Assignment: Week 2

This repo is my Week 2 assignment submission for the Developing Data Products course of the Coursera/John Hopkins University Data Science Specialisation.

It is an interactive map of publicly-funded cultural institutions in Berlin and was created using RStudio and the Leaflet. More details can be found in the .html

which is also hosted on github pages [here]().
